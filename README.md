# Pudding üçÆ

Pudding is a proof of concept service to download beacon states, generate proofs and pre-emptively cache proofs for
quick access. Pudding is build with Rust, Docker Compose, and Redis.

## Features

- Download cryptographic proofs for finalised beacon states.
- Pre-emptively download finalised states, generate and cache proofs in the background.
- Dockerized setup for easy deployment and testing.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, use Docker Compose:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Note: it might take some time for lodestar to sync a finalised state and for pudding to then generate and cache the
first proof. You can check the logs to see the progress.

### API Usage

Once the project is running, you can access the API to generate and retrieve proofs.

##### Endpoint

GET /proof/state

##### Query Parameters

state_id: The ID of the state (or ``head``) you want to retrieve the proof for.
path: The path within the state for which you need the proof. Currently, only ``finalized_checkpoint,root`` is
pre-cached. If you have common paths you need proofs for, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

#### Example Request

```sh
curl "http://localhost:9000/proof/state?state_id=8865728&path=finalized_checkpoint,root"
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "state_id": "8865728",
  "path": "finalized_checkpoint,root",
  "proof": "base64_encoded_proof_data"
}
```
